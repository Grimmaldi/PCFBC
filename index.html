      <h3 class="heading">PCFBC Ministries</h3>
      <p>PCFBC Student Ministries is a place where middle and high school students can come and learn about the impact that Jesus Christ can make in their life through salvation.  In a world where distractions are constant, we want to refocus and give students an understanding of how to have an authentic relationship with God and how to be a source of God’s love in a broken world.  We want to make Jesus known in the lives of our students so that they can teach others to know Him too.</p>

      <h3 class="heading">Vision</h3>
      <p>To Love God and Love others by investing in them, in order that they may live out their God given destiny. </p>

      <h3 class="heading">Strategy</h3>
      <p>We exist to lead students to Jesus, connect them to PCFBC, help them grow in their faith through discipleship, and challenge them to impact the world.
    </p>

      <h3 class="heading">Values</h3>
      <p><strong>People matter to God</strong>. We provide a safe place for students to meet Jesus at their point of need. We want students to have a safe place to grow in their relationship with God and others. We want to help students find a place to belong and point them to find their identity in Christ <bold></bold><em>(Galatians 3:27-28</em>, <em>1 Timothy 4:12</em>, <em>Revelation 7:9-10</em>, <em>1 Corinthians 12:12-31</em>, <em>Luke 19:10</em>. <em>Psalm 61:1-2).</em></p>

    <p><strong>Worship is a lifestyle</strong>. We value students living out a life of worship in their everyday lives. Following Jesus is a lifestyle, not an event. We want our gathering to be an overflow of what God is doing in their lives each week (<em>Romans 12:1-2</em>, <em>Galatians 2:20</em>).
    </p>

    <p><strong>Teaching for life-change</strong>. We value relating God’s truths to his generation. We value connecting God’s truth with action. Teaching is the catalyst that leads to transformed lives (<em>2 Timothy 3:16</em>, <em>Hebrews 4:12-13</em>, <em>Ephesians 6:1-19</em>, <em>Luke 6:47-49, John 8:32</em>).
    </p>

    <p><strong>Every every student, is a minister</strong>.  We Develop students to serve and find God’s calling for their lives. We want students to understand how God has gifted and equipped them for life long service (<em>1 Timothy 4:12</em>, <em>Ephesians 4:1-14</em>, <em>Luke 22:26, Mark 10:42-45</em>).</p>

    <p><strong>Partnering with parents</strong>. We value our role to team up with parents to teach students to be Christ-followers. We are another voice in the lives of students as we come alongside parents as a team. The essence of student ministry is to aid the family in helping their student in become independently dependent of their relationship with Christ (<em>Deuteronomy 6:4</em>, <em>Ephesians 6:4</em>).</p>

    <p><strong>Impacting the world</strong>. We value students developing a lifestyle of sharing their faith. Our desire to make disciples who make disciples of all nations (Matthew 28:19-20, Acts 1:8, Matthew 5:16, Mark 16:15).</p>
